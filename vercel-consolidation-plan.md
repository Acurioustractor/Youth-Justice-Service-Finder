# ðŸ§¹ Vercel Project Consolidation Plan

## Current Issue
Multiple Vercel projects are causing confusion and authentication issues:
- `youth-justice-services` 
- `frontend` (currently active)
- `youth-justice-finder`

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach: Create New Clean Project

### Step 1: Create Brand New Vercel Project
```bash
cd frontend

# Remove current Vercel project link
rm -rf .vercel

# Create new project with proper name
vercel --name youth-justice-service-finder-official
```

### Step 2: Configure New Project Properly
```bash
# Set environment variables for new project
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter: https://youth-justice-service-finder-production.up.railway.app

# Deploy with optimized build
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Old Projects
After new project is working:

```bash
# List all projects to get exact names
vercel projects ls

# Remove old projects one by one
vercel projects rm frontend
vercel projects rm youth-justice-services  
vercel projects rm youth-justice-finder
```

## ðŸš€ Alternative: Use Railway Full-Stack (Recommended)

Since Vercel keeps causing issues, deploy everything to Railway:

### Step 1: Railway Full-Stack Setup
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new service for frontend
railway add

# Deploy full-stack application
railway up
```

### Benefits of Railway Full-Stack:
âœ… **Single Platform**: No multiple project confusion
âœ… **No Auth Issues**: Direct control over deployment
âœ… **Same Backend**: Already working perfectly on Railway
âœ… **Cost Effective**: One bill, one platform
âœ… **Simpler**: No cross-platform configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Action Plan

### Option A: Clean Vercel Start
1. Delete `.vercel` folder
2. Create new project: `youth-justice-service-finder-official`
3. Deploy with proper configuration
4. Delete old projects

### Option B: Move to Railway (Recommended)
1. Use Railway for both frontend and backend
2. Single domain: `your-app.railway.app`
3. No authentication issues
4. Simpler management
