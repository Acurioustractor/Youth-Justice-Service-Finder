# ‚è∞ Automated Data Refresh Scheduling System

## **Overview**

The Youth Justice Service Finder now includes a **fully automated scheduling system** that continuously refreshes service data from multiple government sources. This system runs 24/7 in production, ensuring users always have access to the most current information.

---

## **üîÑ How the Automated System Works**

### **Production Pipeline Service**

The `src/pipeline-service.js` runs as a containerized service that:

1. **Schedules automatic extractions** using cron expressions
2. **Manages job queues** for concurrent data processing  
3. **Handles error recovery** with automatic retries
4. **Monitors data quality** and extraction success rates
5. **Stores results** directly to the production database
6. **Provides real-time status** via HTTP endpoints

### **Scheduling Configuration**

```javascript
// Default schedules in production
const schedules = {
    fullPipeline: '0 2 * * *',      // Daily at 2:00 AM
    highFrequency: '0 */6 * * *',   // Every 6 hours
    acncUpdate: '0 1 * * 1',        // Weekly on Monday at 1:00 AM
    qldData: '0 3 1 * *',           // Monthly on 1st at 3:00 AM
    vicData: '0 4 1 * *'            // Monthly on 1st at 4:00 AM
};
```

```bash
# Check if pipeline is currently running
curl http://localhost:3002/status | jq '.isRunning'

# View recent job history
curl http://localhost:3002/status | jq '.lastRun'

# Monitor extraction progress (real-time)
curl -N http://localhost:3002/stream  # If implemented
```

### **Database Maintenance**

```bash
# Trigger database cleanup

curl http://localhost:3002/export > services_backup.json
```

## **üìä Continuous Source Discovery**

### **Automated Source Detection**

The system continuously discovers new data sources through:

1. **Government API Monitoring**: Tracks data.gov.au for new datasets
2. **Link Analysis**: Follows references from existing sources
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies similar data patterns
4. **Manual Queue**: Accepts suggestions for new sources

### **Source Evaluation Process**

```javascript
// Automatic source evaluation criteria
const sourceEvaluation = {
    dataQuality: 0.8,        // 80%+ complete records
    updateFrequency: 'monthly', // At least monthly updates
    legalCompliance: true,    // Open license/public access
    youthRelevance: 0.6,     // 60%+ youth-specific services
    geographicCoverage: 'state' // State-level or broader
};
```

### **New Source Integration**

When a new source is discovered:
1. **Automated testing** of data access and format
2. **Quality assessment** of sample data
3. **Integration feasibility** analysis  
4. **Admin notification** for approval
5. **Automatic adapter creation** (if standardized)
6. **Production deployment** after testing

---

## **üö® Error Handling & Recovery**

### **Automatic Error Recovery**

```javascript
// Error handling strategy
const errorHandling = {
    networkErrors: 'retry_with_backoff',
    rateLimiting: 'respect_limits_and_queue',
    dataFormatErrors: 'log_and_continue',
    authenticationErrors: 'alert_admin_and_pause',
    systemErrors: 'restart_service'
};
```

### **Retry Logic**

- **Network failures**: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic throttling and queuing
- **Data errors**: Skip record and continue processing
- **System errors**: Service restart and continuation

### **Alerting System**

**Slack Integration:**
```bash
# Configure Slack webhook in .env.production
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/your-webhook

# Automatic alerts for:
# - Pipeline failures
# - Data quality drops
# - New source discoveries
# - System performance issues
```

**Email Notifications:**
```bash
# Configure admin email
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourorganization.com

# Daily summary reports
# Weekly quality reports  
# Monthly source performance reviews
```

---

## **üìà Performance Optimization**

### **Automatic Tuning**

The system automatically adjusts:

- **Batch sizes** based on processing speed
- **Concurrent jobs** based on system resources
- **Rate limits** based on source responses
- **Quality thresholds** based on data trends

### **Resource Management**

```javascript
// Dynamic resource allocation
const resourceManagement = {
    maxMemoryUsage: '80%',
    maxCpuUsage: '70%',
    maxConcurrentJobs: 3,
    batchSize: 'auto', // Adjusts 50-200 based on performance
    timeoutThresholds: 'adaptive'
};
```

### **Database Optimization**

- **Automatic index maintenance**
- **Query performance monitoring**
- **Storage optimization**
- **Connection pool management**

## **üîç Data Quality Assurance**

### **Continuous Quality Monitoring**

The system tracks:
- **Completeness scores** for each service
- **Data freshness** indicators
- **Source reliability** ratings
- **Duplicate detection** accuracy
- **Geographic coverage** gaps

### **Quality Improvement Process**

1. **Automated quality scoring** for all services
2. **Trend analysis** to identify declining sources
3. **Automatic data enhancement** where possible
4. **Source prioritization** based on quality
5. **Manual review queues** for problematic data

### **Quality Metrics Dashboard**

```bash
# View current quality metrics
curl http://localhost:3002/quality-metrics

# Example response:
{
  "averageQuality": 0.73,
  "qualityTrends": {
    "improving": ["acnc", "qld-data"],
    "declining": [],
