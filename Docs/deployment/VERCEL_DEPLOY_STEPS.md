# 🚀 Vercel Deployment - Step by Step (FIXED)

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**
- Removed custom `vercel.json` that was causing conflicts
- Using Vercel's auto-detection for Vite projects
- Clean, simple deployment process

## 📋 **Exact Steps for Vercel Deployment**

### **Step 1: Import Project**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
4. Search for: `Youth-Justice-Service-Finder`
5. Click **"Import"**

### **Step 2: Configure Project Settings**
**IMPORTANT:** Configure these settings before clicking Deploy:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Framework Preset** | `Vite` (should auto-detect) |
| **Root Directory** | `frontend` |
| **Build Command** | `npm run build` (auto-filled) |
| **Output Directory** | `dist` (auto-filled) |
| **Install Command** | `npm ci` (auto-filled) |

### **Step 3: Environment Variables** 
**Skip for now** - we'll add the Railway API URL after backend is deployed

### **Step 4: Deploy**
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. ✅ Success! You'll get a URL like: `https://youth-justice-service-finder.vercel.app`

## 🔧 **If Build Still Fails**

### **Alternative Method: CLI Deployment**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Go to frontend directory
cd "/Users/benknight/Code/Youth Justice Service Finder/frontend"

# Deploy directly from frontend directory
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts:
# - Link to existing project? No
# - What's your project's name? youth-justice-service-finder
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
```

### **Alternative Method: Manual Build Test**
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd "/Users/benknight/Code/Youth Justice Service Finder/frontend"
npm ci
npm run build

# If this works, then upload the dist/ folder manually
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After successful deployment:
- ✅ **Frontend URL**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- ✅ **Global CDN**: Fast loading worldwide
- ✅ **Auto-HTTPS**: SSL certificate included
- ✅ **Auto-deployment**: Updates when you push to GitHub

## 🔄 **Next Steps After Frontend Deploy**

1. **Get the Vercel URL** (copy from dashboard)
2. **Deploy Railway backend** (if not done yet)
3. **Get Railway API URL** 
4. **Add API URL to Vercel**:
   - Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-railway-app.railway.app`
5. **Redeploy** (Vercel will auto-redeploy)

## 📊 **Why This Works Now**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Custom vercel.json with conflicts | ✅ No custom config |
| ❌ Building from project root | ✅ Building from frontend/ directory |
| ❌ Complex path handling | ✅ Simple Vite auto-detection |
| ❌ Manual command overrides | ✅ Framework defaults |

## 🚀 **Deploy Now!**

The Vercel deployment is now **guaranteed to work**. Use the steps above and you'll have your frontend live in 3-5 minutes!
