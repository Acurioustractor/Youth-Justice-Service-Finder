  - Real-time progress monitoring
  - Event-driven architecture

### 6. Error Handling & Monitoring
- **File**: `src/data-pipeline/utils/error-handler.js`
- **Features**:
  - Circuit breaker pattern for failing sources
  - Categorized error logging (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Retry strategies with adaptive rate limiting
  - Log rotation and export capabilities
  - Real-time error statistics

### 7. Rate Limiting System
- **File**: `src/data-pipeline/utils/rate-limiter.js`
- **Features**:
  - Token bucket algorithm
  - Adaptive rate adjustment based on API responses
  - Request queuing and throttling
  - Source-specific rate limits
