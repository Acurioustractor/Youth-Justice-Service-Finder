# ðŸš¨ **MANUAL RAILWAY DEPLOY - GET 603 SERVICES LIVE**

## **SINCE CLI ISN'T WORKING, DO THIS:**

### **Step 1: Railway Dashboard Deploy**
1. Go to **https://railway.app/dashboard**
2. Find your **"abundant-mercy"** project
3. Click on your **main service** (probably labeled "youth-justice..." or similar)
4. Look for a **"Deploy"**, **"Redeploy"**, or **"..."** menu button
5. Click it and select **"Redeploy"** or **"Trigger Deploy"**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### **Step 2: Test Import Endpoint**
Once Railway shows "Deployed" status:

```bash
curl -X POST https://youth-justice-service-finder-production.up.railway.app/create-data/load-603-services
```

### **Step 3: Verify Results**
```bash
curl https://youth-justice-service-finder-production.up.railway.app/stats
```

Should show something like:
```json
{"totals":{"services":603,"organizations":400}}
```

## **ALTERNATIVE: Force Deploy via Git**

If Railway dashboard doesn't work:

```bash
# Make a trivial change to force redeploy
cd "/Users/benknight/Code/Youth Justice Service Finder"
echo "# Force redeploy $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Force Railway redeploy"
git push
```

Railway will auto-detect the push and redeploy.

## **EXPECTED RESULT**

After successful deployment and import:
- âœ… **603 services** in your live database
- âœ… **Real Australia-wide data** on your frontend
- âœ… **No more demo mode**
- âœ… **Working search** with full dataset

---

**Bottom line: Railway dashboard redeploy â†’ API call â†’ 603 services live in 5 minutes!**
